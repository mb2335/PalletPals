                <div><h2>Action</h2> </div>
                <div><p>The action proposed is to collaborate with the iSchool to develop a UI/UX platform that collects and visualizes data from dual sources, i.e., residents of Pallet villages and village staff, to measure the efficacy of non-congregate village models in addressing health, wellbeing, and homelessness for individuals.
                </p>
                <div><h2>Solution
                </h2> </div>
                <div><p>The solution is to create an easy-to-use platform accessed by end-users, where residents can self-report on their experience in the Pallet village over time, and staff can easily report data on residents' housing journeys on a consistent basis. The data will be anonymized, and the platform will auto-aggregate the data into a simple, elegant visual dashboard where impacts are easily accessible and shareable. This will aid in measuring the efficacy of village models in addressing health, wellbeing, and homelessness for individuals.

            <div><h2>OUR Solution
            </h2> </div>
            <div><p>We created a Google Forms survey for all residents and service partners to be able to self-report on their experience. We also created a dashboard for Pallet villages and staff to easily report and access data about health, wellbeing, and homelessness for individuals. We also created a project proposal/roadmap in order to ensure Pallet is on the right track to get the data they want in a way they want it. This is because the Google Surveys did leave out the aspect for personalization, which was something they wanted to incorporate.
