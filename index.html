                    Pallet Shelter is a non-profit organization committed to ending unsheltered homelessness. They construct transitional shelter villages to help people transition from living on the streets to permanent housing. To ease the challenge of receiving consistent data regarding the impact of villages on individuals experiencing homelessness, we created a platform that collects data from village staff to measure the efficacy of non-congregate village models in addressing health, well-being, and homelessness for individuals. Also, Google Forms surveys were created for residents and service partners to self-report their experience, and a dashboard was created for staff to analyze and access data. A project proposal was also created to ensure Pallet is on the right track to get the data they want to enhance our solution.
